# SomeSwiftCS
This is a simple Swift playground of common algorithms, data structures and coding challenge implementations that I've built up along the way while refreshing on some common computer science principles to prepare for Swift coding interviews.  Examples and solutions are all in Swift and come from a variety of sources such as my pared-down versions of some Ray Wenderlich Swift Algorithm Club examples, Swift-based solutions to HackerRank challenges, and several others.  

This playground is by no means exhaustive; it does not follow any plan or syllabus. The algorithms are not necessarily robust, handling any/all types and/or error states.
