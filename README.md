# SomeSwiftCS
This is a simple Swift playground of common algorithms, data structures and coding challenge implementations that I've built up along the way while refreshing on some common computer science principles to prepare for Swift coding interviews.  Examples and solutions are all in Swift and come from a variety of sources such as my pared-down versions of some Ray Wenderlich Swift Algorithm Club examples, Swift-based solutions to HackerRank challenges, and several others.  

This playground is by no means exhaustive, nor does it follow any itinerary or syllabus.  Simply put, this playground is basically a history of many of the items I've worked through in Swift.  As I working through new stuff, I'll add it as a new page in the playground.
